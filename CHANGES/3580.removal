Drop explicit loop. Use ``asyncio.get_event_loop()`` instead if the loop instance is needed.
All ezyhttp objects work with the currently running loop, a creation of ezyhttp instances, e.g. ClientSession when the loop is not running is forbidden.
As a side effect of PR passing callables to ``ezyhttp_server()`` and ``ezyhttp_client()`` pytest fixtures are forbidden, please call these callables explicitly.
