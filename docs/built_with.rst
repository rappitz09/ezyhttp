Built with ezyhttp
==================

ezyhttp is used to build useful libraries built on top of it,
and there's a page dedicated to list them: :ref:`ezyhttp-3rd-party`.

There are also projects that leverage the power of ezyhttp to
provide end-user tools, like command lines or software with
full user interfaces.

This page aims to list those projects. If you are using ezyhttp
in your software and if it's playing a central role, you
can add it here in this list.

You can also add a **Built with ezyhttp** link somewhere in your
project, pointing to `<https://github.com/rappitz09/ezyhttp>`_.
